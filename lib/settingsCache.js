 * settingsCache.js
 *
 * A lightweight in-memory cache for global bot settings (database/db.js's
 * getSettings()/updateSetting()). Loaded once at startup and kept in sync
 * on every write, so hot-path code in index.js (checked on every message)
 * can read settings synchronously instead of awaiting the database on
 * every single message.
 *
 * This is simpler than BLAZE-XMD's TTL+pubsub settingsCache.js (which
 * exists to stay consistent across multiple processes/dynos) since this
 * project runs a single dyno — a write-through cache is enough and avoids
 * any staleness window entirely.
